# Notes:

## Come back to
I allowed Address to accept null in database. Look into using Google Maps Reverse Geocoding to get address from Lat/Lng

After adding Image model, revisit BusinessIndexItem and Business Page. Will also need default "no-image" image

removed return statement from store onDispatch

don't forget jbuilder if getting ajax errors

just have map and search on homepage. this would take away the bestOf and the recentActivity. changed Index.jsx

maybe don't allow businesses to be submitted. make sure to remove route and controller function

add filters component and to search jsx

benchbnb search.jsx - contextTypes

revisit logo image

tracked bug down to api_actions receiveAll
