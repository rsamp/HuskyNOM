## Come back to

After adding Image model, revisit BusinessIndexItem and Business Page. Will also need default "no-image" image

search.jsx setinterval
Map Loading... -> No results Search.jsx: Use the store to know when results are finished being filtered. Similar issue with if no reviews yet for a business

show stars in review index item
set minimum rating. use flash errors? could be annoying with react.

remove "non-react" message from root

flash error messages

hours on business form

Bonus: open now - hours

improve markers: change color on index item hover

idea for images on business submit form:
after uploading, show image and an option to delete

edit reviews

profile page

spacing of filters- buttons maybe?

Peer feedback:
put images in a box

formatting of review index item:
make user area a bit bigger, take away "Date:" and "Body:"

validate against empty stars

algorithm for 'most popular'

map connection to business index
