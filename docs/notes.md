## Come back to

After adding Image model, revisit BusinessIndexItem and Business Page. Will also need default "no-image" image

search.jsx setinterval
Map Loading... -> No results Search.jsx: Use the store to know when results are finished being filtered. Similar issue with if no reviews yet for a business

revisit printing of Date. can I use 'new Date(pass any format here)'?

show stars in review index item
set minimum rating. use flash errors? could be annoying with react.

remove "non-react" message from root

how to defend against entering something in address bar manually. breaks functionality of site

flash error messages

hours on business form

Bonus: open now - hours

improve markers: change color on index item hover, have an onclick balloon

idea for images on business submit form:
after uploading, show image and an option to delete

pagination - business index, reviews, images

edit reviews

profile page

spacing of filters- buttons maybe?

Peer feedback:
put images in a box

formatting of review index item:
make user area a bit bigger, take away "Date:" and "Body:"

password confirmation on sign up

long username goes into review. set max on length, increase column width

parse over entire string for search

validate against empty stars

algorithm for 'most popular'

map connection to business index
